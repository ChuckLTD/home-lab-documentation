# Step 12: Install Windows 11 VM

## Summary

This step covers installing a Windows 11 virtual machine in VirtualBox for use inside the home lab. Iâ€™m using the Windows 11 Enterprise ISO provided by Microsoftâ€™s Evaluation Centerâ€”free for 90 days. This machine will eventually be domain-joined, monitored by Sysmon, and used to simulate attacks and policies.

## Downloading Windows 11

You can grab the ISO directly from Microsoft here:  
ðŸ”— [Windows 11 Enterprise | Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-11-enterprise)

Youâ€™ll need to register and choose your language. Select the **64-bit** version and save it somewhere easy to find.

## Creating the VM in VirtualBox

Once the ISO is downloaded:

1. **Open VirtualBox** and click **New**
2. Name the VM something like `Win11-Lab`
3. Under ISO Image, browse to the ISO you downloaded
4. The OS type/version should autofill to Windows 11, but confirm it's correct
5. **Skip unattended installation** (this is important)
6. Allocate hardware:
   - 2 CPUs  
   - 4GB+ RAM (based on your system)
   - Enable EFI (required for Win11 install to work properly)
7. Create a virtual hard disk:
   - 50GB recommended
   - Dynamically allocated (donâ€™t pre-allocate full size)

## VM Settings Tweaks (Important!)

Before launching the install, update the following:

- **System â†’ Boot Order:**
  - Move Hard Disk to the top
  - Uncheck Floppy
  - Re-enable EFI and Secure Boot afterward

- **Audio â†’ Disable**

- **Network â†’ Adapter 1:**
  - Set to **Internal Network**
  - Name: `LAN 0`
  - Adapter Type: **Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop**

This adapter will let the VM get its IP from pfSense via DHCP.

## Installing Windows 11

Start the VM and be ready to hit a key when promptedâ€”if you miss the window, youâ€™ll have to reboot. Trust me, I missed it once.

- Choose your language, region, and keyboard
- Accept license terms and click **Next**
- Start the full installation (no product key required for the evaluation)
- Select **Domain Join instead** when asked for a Microsoft account
- Create a local user and password (donâ€™t forget this!)
- Skip second keyboard and unnecessary settings
- After updates and restarts, log in with your local account

---

## Test Network Connectivity

After logging in:

1. Open **Command Prompt**
2. Run `ipconfig`

You should see a 10.0.1.x IP if DHCP is working and pfSense is configured properly.

## Optional: Install Guest Additions

To make your life easier, install VirtualBox Guest Additions:
- Mount the ISO (Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image)
- Run the installer and reboot
- Enable clipboard sharing (Settings > General > Advanced â†’ Bidirectional)

This gives you:
- Better graphics/resolution
- Shared clipboard
- Drag-and-drop (sometimes)
