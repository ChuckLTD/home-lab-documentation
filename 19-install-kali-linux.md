## Install Kali Linux

Start the VM and:

1. Choose **Graphical Install**
2. Select:
   - Language
   - Location
   - Keyboard layout
3. Hostname: Choose one for your Kali VM
4. Leave domain name blank
5. Create a user and password
6. Select time zone
7. Choose to use the **entire disk**
8. Accept partitioning and select default values
9. Confirm installation

## First Boot and Network Test

After installation:

- Log in with the credentials you created
- Open Terminal and run:

## Install VirtualBox Guest Additions

1. Go to **Devices â†’ Insert Guest Additions CD Image**
2. Open Terminal in Kali and run the following:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
cd /mnt/cdrom
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

### What each command does:
- `mkdir`: Creates a mount point for the CD.
- `mount`: Mounts the virtual Guest Additions CD.
- `cd`: Enters the mounted directory.
- `VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`: Executes the installer script.

3. After installation, **reboot the system**.

You may now be able to use full-screen mode, clipboard sharing, and drag-and-drop functionality.
